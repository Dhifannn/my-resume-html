    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a student currently pursuing my education at Universitas Padjadjaran,
      specifically enrolled in the Informatics Engineering program. At present, I
      am in the 5th semester of my academic journey. My fondness for technology
      and information has driven me to choose this educational path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the past four semesters, I have developed a solid understanding of
      various aspects within the realm of Informatics engineering. Courses such
      as programming, algorithms, data structures, and databases have equipped
      me with the necessary knowledge to tackle challenges in this field.
      Moreover, I have been actively involved in various extracurricular
      activities, such as personal projects, association organizations and many
      committees
    </p>
    <p>
      In this current semester, my aspiration is to further broaden my knowledge
      in the field of Informatics Engineering. I am excited to delve into more
      specific topics which is Web Development. Additionally, I intend to
      partake in collaborative projects with my classmates, aiming to apply
      acquired knowledge in real-world scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>
      I firmly believe that education is an endless journey, and I am committed
      to continuous learning and growth to make a positive contribution in the
      information technology industry in the future. I am incredibly grateful
      for the opportunity to pursue my passion at Universitas Padjadjaran within
      the Informatics Engineering program.
